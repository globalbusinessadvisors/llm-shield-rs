## About This Planning Package

### Methodology
This planning package was created using:
- Analysis of the llm-guard Python codebase
- Research on Rust ML ecosystem (ONNX, Candle, tokenizers)
- WASM compatibility assessment
- Industry best practices for large-scale conversions
- Risk-based planning approach

### Assumptions
- Team has Rust experience (can be acquired)
- ML models can be converted to ONNX format
- ONNX Runtime or Candle will work in WASM
- Python reference implementation remains available
- Incremental rollout is acceptable

### Limitations
- "Portalis" transpiler mentioned in original request was not found
- Planning assumes manual/semi-manual conversion with tooling support
- WASM ML support is experimental and may require workarounds
- Actual timeline may vary based on team expertise
