  License: MIT
  Stars: 1.8k+
  Python Files: 217
  Core LOC: ~9,000
  Input Scanners: 17 types
  Output Scanners: 24 types
  Secret Plugins: 95 custom detectors
  ML Models: 15+ HuggingFace transformers
  Dependencies: 15 core packages

ARCHITECTURE PATTERN:
  ✓ Protocol-based scanner design
  ✓ Simple interface: scan(text) → (sanitized, valid, score)
  ✓ Modular, composable scanners
  ✓ Lazy loading of ML models
  ✓ ONNX support for optimization
  ✓ FastAPI REST interface

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT

OVERALL FEASIBILITY: HIGH ✅

Breakdown:
  Core Infrastructure: LOW complexity ✅
  Simple Scanners (7): LOW complexity ✅
  ML Scanners (15+): MEDIUM complexity ⚠️
  Secret Detection: MEDIUM complexity ⚠️
  PII Detection: HIGH complexity ⚠️
  API Layer: LOW complexity ✅

Critical Success Factors:
  ✓ ONNX Runtime provides production ML path
  ✓ Most scanners straightforward to port

  ✓ Performance gains justify effort
  
Challenges:
  ⚠️ Presidio (PII) requires custom implementation
  ⚠️ 95 secret plugins need manual porting

⚠️ CRITICAL RISKS & MITIGATION

RISK 1: ML Model Compatibility (HIGH)
  Impact: Could force hybrid Rust/Python approach
  Probability: Medium
  Mitigation:
    ✓ Early ONNX validation (Month 4)
    ✓ Accuracy benchmarks vs Python
    ✓ Keep PyO3 as fallback
    ✓ Gradual migration strategy

RISK 2: Accuracy Degradation (HIGH)
  Impact: Product not acceptable if <99% accuracy
  Probability: Medium
  Mitigation:
    ✓ Comprehensive test dataset
    ✓ Continuous accuracy monitoring
    ✓ ONNX vs PyTorch validation
    ✓ Accept higher precision if needed

RISK 3: Development Timeline (MEDIUM)
  Impact: Delayed release, cost overruns
  Probability: High
  Mitigation:
    ✓ Phased approach with checkpoints
    ✓ Monthly go/no-go gates
    ✓ Flexible scope (nice-to-haves)
    ✓ Parallel workstreams

RISK 4: Presidio Replacement (MEDIUM)
  Impact: Missing PII detection features
  Probability: Medium
  Mitigation:
    ✓ Phased implementation (regex → NER → context)
    ✓ PyO3 bridge as fallback
    ✓ Custom test suite
    ✓ Gradual feature additions

🎯 FINAL RECOMMENDATION

RECOMMENDATION: ✅ PROCEED WITH CONVERSION

Rationale:
  ✓ Technically feasible with identified approach
  ✓ Clear performance benefits (4-10x improvement)
  ✓ Phased approach reduces risk
  ✓ ONNX provides production ML path
  ✓ Rust ecosystem has necessary libraries
  ✓ 8-12 month timeline is reasonable
  ✓ Benefits justify the investment

Conditions:
  ⚠️ Commit 2-3 FTE for 12 months
  ⚠️ Budget for compute resources (~$10k)
  ⚠️ Monthly checkpoints and go/no-go gates
  ⚠️ Accept gradual feature additions
  ⚠️ Keep Python version maintained during transition

Alternative:
  If resources constrained: Start with Phase 1 proof-of-concept (3 months)
  Validate ONNX approach, measure performance, then commit to full conversion
