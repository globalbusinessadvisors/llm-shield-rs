# LLM-Guard Python to Rust/WASM Conversion
## Executive Summary

**Date:** January 30, 2025
**Project:** llm-guard Rust/WASM Migration
**Status:** Planning Phase
**Duration:** 32 weeks (8 months)

## Overview

This document provides a high-level summary of the comprehensive strategy to convert the llm-guard Python security toolkit to Rust with WebAssembly (WASM) support. The conversion will deliver significant performance improvements, reduced memory footprint, and browser compatibility while maintaining security guarantees.

### What is LLM-Guard?

LLM-Guard is a comprehensive security toolkit for Large Language Model (LLM) applications that provides:
- **Input sanitization** (15+ scanners for prompt security)
- **Output validation** (21+ scanners for response verification)
- **Threat detection** (prompt injection, toxicity, PII leakage)
- **Data protection** (anonymization, secret detection)

**Current State:** Python-based, 2.2k GitHub stars, production-ready
**Target State:** Rust implementation with WASM support

## Business Value

### Performance Improvements

| Metric | Python Baseline | Rust Target | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Rule-based scanners** | 5ms | 1ms | **5x faster** |
| **ML scanners** | 50ms | 25ms | **2x faster** |
| **Memory (base)** | 50-100 MB | 5-10 MB | **10x reduction** |
| **Memory (per model)** | 500-1000 MB | 200-500 MB | **2x reduction** |
| **Cold start** | 2-5s | 0.5-1s | **4x faster** |

### New Capabilities

1. **Browser Deployment:** Run security checks client-side via WASM
2. **Edge Computing:** Deploy on Cloudflare Workers, Fastly Compute@Edge
3. **Embedded Systems:** Run on resource-constrained devices
4. **Better Concurrency:** Native async/await with zero-cost abstractions

### Cost Savings

**Infrastructure:**
- 50-70% reduction in compute costs (faster execution)
- 80-90% reduction in memory costs (smaller footprint)
- Reduced latency = better user experience

**Example:** 1M requests/day
- Python: $500/month (assumed baseline)
- Rust: $150-250/month (50-70% reduction)
- **Annual Savings: $3,000-4,200**

## Risk Assessment

### Critical Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **ML accuracy loss** | Critical | Medium | Extensive validation suite, tolerance testing |
| **ONNX WASM support** | High | High | Test early, Candle as fallback |
| **Development timeline** | Medium | Medium | Incremental delivery, phased rollout |
| **Team expertise** | Medium | Low | Training, pair programming, external consultants |

### Risk Mitigation Strategy

1. **Early Validation:** Validate ML conversion in Phase 1
2. **Parallel Paths:** Maintain Python reference implementation
3. **Incremental Rollout:** Alpha → Beta → RC → GA
4. **Automated Testing:** 80%+ coverage, continuous benchmarking
5. **Fallback Plans:** Keep Python version available for critical issues
